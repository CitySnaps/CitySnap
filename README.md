# CitySnap
An iOS application for people in Toronto to quickly report defects or problems requiring repair to city authorities.

CitySnap through its simple interface allows the user to upload an image of any problem, with a dashboard website that updates
in real time with the photos that the users have uploaded, grouped together by category and location to eliminate duplicates.
